## What is protein monster?
No one knows. some claim for it to be an ARG (alternate reality game), but then there would have to be a story. Some claim for it to be a fun side project, but what side project has over 200 subdirectories, with complex unity games, Three.js, and more? 

For what it's worth, it's a deeply interconnected webpage with subdirectories connecting to other subdirectories, and even has it's own [subdirectories in subdirectories](https://github.com/quinnha/protein-monster-visualizer/blob/main/media/subdirectories.png). I wanted to see how connected these nodes are, and even see how deep the protein monster rabbithole goes!

## Findings
total pages: 229

total edges: 846

*note these numbers do not include pages/edges connected to unity applications*

## Why is protein monster?
I tried, asking, this is what they said:

However, they did send me some stickers!

## Next Steps
- Link Unity applications to the graph
- Add extra findings (number of unity pages, ThreeJS applications, videos)
- Create Markov chain depicting probabilities and randomness of entering a page
- Clean up some empty nodes
- Manually add Christmas node
